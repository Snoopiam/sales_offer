**Based on:** Audit Report (2025-12-31)
**Current Score:** 77/100
**Target Score:** 85/100

---

## Summary

The application is in good health with ESLint working and zero security vulnerabilities. The main remaining improvement is test coverage - updating tests to import actual source files instead of mocks.

## Completed Actions

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Fix ESLint configuration | Done |
| Update dev dependencies (vitest 4.0.16) | Done |
| Resolve security vulnerabilities | Done |

## Remaining Actions

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Improve test coverage | Pending |
| 2 | Update jsdom (optional) | Pending |
| 3 | Resolve TODO in storage.js | Pending |
| 4 | Fix ESLint warnings | Pending |

## Phase 1: Test Coverage

### Improve Test Coverage

Current tests use mocks and don't import actual source files. Update tests to:

1. Import real modules from `js/modules/*.js`
2. Mock only external dependencies (localStorage, DOM)
3. Target 60%+ coverage

**Files to update:**
- `tests/helpers.test.js` - Import from `js/utils/helpers.js`
- `tests/calculator.test.js` - Import from `js/modules/calculator.js`
- `tests/validator.test.js` - Import from `js/modules/validator.js`

---

## Phase 2: Minor Cleanup

### Update jsdom (Optional)

```bash
npm install jsdom@latest --save-dev
```

### Resolve TODO

Location: `js/modules/storage.js:500`

```javascript
// TODO: Real compression should be done when image is uploaded
```

**Action:** Move image compression to upload time instead of storage time.

### Fix ESLint Warnings

Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix 3 warnings, then manually remove unused imports.

## Expected Outcome

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Health Score | 77/100 | 85/100 |
| ESLint | Working | Working |
| Vulnerabilities | 0 | 0 |
| Test Coverage | 30% | 60%+ |
| Outdated packages | 1 | 0 |
